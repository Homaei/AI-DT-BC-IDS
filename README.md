# Smart Water Security with AI and Blockchain-Enhanced Digital Twins

This repository contains the implementation of a secure, intelligent digital twin (DT) platform for rural water distribution networks. The system integrates **LoRaWAN-based data acquisition**, an **AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using **LSTM Autoencoder and Isolation Forest**, and a **private Ethereum blockchain** with **Proof of Authority (PoA)** to ensure tamper-proof and transparent water management.

## 🌐 Project Description

Water systems in under-connected rural areas are vulnerable to data tampering, inefficiencies, and delayed responses. This project proposes a modular framework combining:

- Digital Twins for real-time monitoring and forecasting.
- Blockchain for secure data storage and billing automation.
- AI for early leak detection and cyberattack prevention.

## 📜 Smart Contract Overview

The Solidity smart contract handles:

- `registerMeter()` for adding new meters
- `logWaterData()` for secure logging
- `calculatePayment()` for auto billing
- `getWaterLogs()` for auditing

```solidity
struct WaterData {
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 waterUsage;
    uint256 errorCode;
    string meterId;
}
mapping(string => WaterData[]) public waterLogs;
function logWaterData(string memory id, uint256 usage, uint256 errCode) public { ... }

🧪 IDS Evaluation Results
Anomaly detection was tested on 400 real/simulated meters with synthetic attack injections.

🚿 Leak Detection Example
Water meters showing non-zero consumption between 00:00–06:00 are flagged.
